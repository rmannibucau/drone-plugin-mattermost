= Drone Mattermost Plugin

[abstract]
A quick Java (native) Drone plugin to send a mattermost notification.

== Usage

IMPORTANT: for simplicity this readme uses `latest` tag but always ensure to pin a particular sha (`rmannibucau/drone-plugin-mattermost:latest@sha256:....`).

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: notify-mattermost
    depends_on:
      - rebuild-cache
    image: rmannibucau/drone-plugin-mattermost:latest
    environment:
      MATTERMOST_CHANNELID: xxxxxx
      MATTERMOST_BASE: https://xxxx:8065
      MATTERMOST_TOKEN:
        from_secret: MATTERMOST_TOKEN
    when:
      status: [ success, failure ]
----

Alternatively you can use the settings section of the plugin to configure mattermost connection:

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: notify-mattermost
    depends_on:
      - rebuild-cache
    image: rmannibucau/drone-plugin-mattermost:latest@sha256:4ef77aa84ea4540d212572c34785f5306c54e16fcbb7972c0b785320c32724fd
    settings:
      channelId: xxxxxx
      base: https://xxxx:8065
      token:
        from_secret: MATTERMOST_TOKEN
    when:
      status: [ success, failure ]
----

== Advanced

The `settings` can also take a `template` string which is a handlebars template.
It will have access to the environment variable of the container/step using their name (`DRONE_COMMIT_SHA` for example) with some syntax tolerance on a dotted notation (`drone.commit.sha`).

See link:https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/environment/reference/[Drone^] environment variable reference documentation.

== Build

As of today the build is manual - since I'm not expecting a lot of iterations:

[source,bash]
----
# build the binary
mvn clean install arthur:native-image

# copy needing dependencies from the OS in the docker context
cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6  target/
cp /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 target/

# build the image
docker build -t rmannibucau/drone-plugin-mattermost .

# publish the image (assumes login was done)
docker push rmannibucau/drone-plugin-mattermost
----
